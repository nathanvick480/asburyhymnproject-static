                        <h3>About Hymns</h3>
                        <p>Hymns have been a core part of Christian music for centuries. While some may find hymns simplistic or boring, they are actually a highly developed form of music designed for a specific purpose: congregational singing. Hymns use repetition, rhyming, and relatively simple melodic lines to help congregations quickly learn the music and then be able to sing in worship together. Unlike more contemporary forms of music, which often require the use of instruments or worship leaders, hymns are intended to be sung by the congregation members themselves. Hymns are most commonly sung in unison, but they are often written in four-part harmony. They can be sung <em>a cappella</em> or with the accompaniment of organ, piano, or a whole host of instruments. Hymns are an incredibly versatile music form that have stood the test of time.</p>

                        <h3>About the Asbury Hymn Project</h3>
                        <p>This project was initiated by Nathan Vick and Kellan Kreft, who recognized that awareness of these hymns was declining among their peers. This is especially significant because hymn singing is a major part of Asbury Reunions. After talking with Dr. Mark Schell, the chair of Asbury University's Music Department who has extensive knowledge of Asbury hymnody, they also realized that there was no collection or listing of the hymns which have been loved and frequently sung by the Asbury University community throughout the decades. To solve these issues, they created the Asbury Hymn Project.</p>
                        <p>Hymns contained in this website were carefully selected by Nathan and Kellan with the guidance of Dr. Schell. Beginning with the list of class hymns, they built a comprehensive list of beloved hymns which represent the heart of Asbury University. Hymns were chosen because of their enduring qualities rather than their popularity at any one point in time. Although the popularity of some hymns has waxed and waned throughout Asbury's history, every hymn on this website has a special place at Asbury.</p>
